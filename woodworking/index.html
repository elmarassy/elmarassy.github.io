              <h4>December 2022 - April 2023</h4>
              <p></p>
              <p>This was my largest and most difficult project, but it was also my favorite by far. There were so
                many
                interesting challenges that came up, and I had fun trying to solve them all. I was super happy with
                the
                final result, especially since the F-14 is my favorite plane.</p>
              <p>The process of building the plane took months of planning, trial, and error, but I have documented
                all
                of the main steps here.</p>

              <p></p>
              <p>The first step was to plan the project. I found an excellent set of <a
                  href="https://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?645874-I-m-sharing-my-F-14A-Tomcat-plans-read-on">plans</a>
                from Matt Halton. They were very detailed and gave tips on some of the more challenging parts of the
                build.</p>
              <p>I then bought all of the supplies I would need. I made sure to purchase compatible parts. I bought
                two
                70A motors that would fit within the fuselage, provide lots of thrust, and not require too large of
                a
                battery. I bought a lot of balsa wood to build the body of the plane, and dozens of random parts
                that
                I
                needed for different systems.</p>

              <p>The right image above shows my initial setup. I used my workbench and desk (which was a work in
                progress at the time) as work surfaces. I printed out full scale plans to use as templates, and a
                smaller 0.5x scale version that I used for reference.</p>
              <p>I my templates to cut out the main structural pieces for the fuselage. I made these pieces out of a
                special type of extra light plywood since they needed to be stronger than the balsa wood used for the
                other parts. I cut them out on my bandsaw and ended up with the pieces shown on the bottom right.</p>

              <p></p>
              <p>As seen in the images, the skeletal pieces of the fuselage were extremely thin. To make sure they
                would
                not break under the weight of a large plane, I reinforced them with some fiberglass. I purchased a
                small
                roll and applied it using some epoxy I had from my woodworking projects.</p>
              <p>I then assembled the front of the fuselage. The bottom was a thick piece of balsa wood that I shaped
                with a knife to match the profile of the plane. I then smoothed it out with some sandpaper.</p>
              <p>I then assembled the back half of the fuselage, which is there the ducts for the motors was. The
                skeleton for this half was very difficult, because it was extremely thin in some areas to allow
                clearance for the intake ducts. I also reinforced this section with fiberglass.</p>
              <p>At this stage, I also installed the two EDF (electronic ducted fan) motors. These are in the back of
                the plane and provide thrust by pulling air through the intake ducts, which are installed in the next
                step.</p>

              <p>I originally made the intake ducts using a thin, clear plastic that I had in my shop. It was flexible
                and easy to shape, which made it a nice material for these ducts which needed a tight radius and
                difficult geometry as seen in the first two images.</p>
              <p>Despite being very flexible, the plastic was still super annoying to shape properly and I spent a few
                hours getting it to work and stay in place. Sadly, as soon as I tested the motors the front intakes
                collapsed due to the high pressure. I needed a stronger material with reinforcements.</p>
              <p>I ended up finding some very thick paper that I had used to make poster boards. I decided to try it,
                and spent a full day trying to shape it since it was even more difficult than the plastic. I needed to
                make lots of cuts in areas where the curvature required stretching the material, but I eventually
                managed to make it work. I reinforced these new ducts with some thin wooden rings that I made on the
                bandsaw, and it was finally able to withstand the pressure.</p>
              <p>I then used balsa wood strips to cover up the fuselage now that I had installed the ducts. I did the
                same carving process from earlier to shape these strips into a smooth body for the plane.</p>

              <p>One of the most challenging parts of the F-14 is the swing wings. The F-14 is capable of sweeping its
                wings back, allowing it to reach higher speeds. This requires the addition of a strong hinge, on which
                the wing can pivot forward and backward. The alignment of the hinges must be perfect so that the
                angles
                of the wings match up exactly along the full trajectory of the sweep, or else changing the angle
                midflight would result in a loss of control.</p>
              <p>I made these wing boxes using the same lightweight, strong plywood reinforced with fiberglass that I
                used for the fuselage skeleton. These needed to be the strongest part of the plane since most of the
                weight of the plane would be supported by just one point of contact on each side.</p>
              <p>I inserted long rods through the hinges in the wing boxes, and tried to align them as well as
                possible
                by eye.</p>
              <p>I then made a wing design, which took several iterations since the first few weren't strong enough.
                Once I came up with a suitable version, I built two and temporarily installed them on the hinges.</p>
              <p>Next, I dialed in the alignment by carefully measuring the angles along several possible wing sweep
                configurations, making sure they matched as well as possible. This stage took several hours of work
                because it was one of the most critical parts of the process.</p>
              <p>I then permanently fixed the wing box orientation, removed the wings, covered them with a layer of
                balsa, and reinstalled them permanently.</p>

              <p>The next step was making the tails. The F-14 has two tails. This model didn't need rudders on the
                tails,
                so I simply carved them out of balsa. </p>
              <p>I also made the rear elecators, which are controlled by servos at the back of the plane. I installed
                these servos, which was very difficult due to the tight space in this region (it was already almost
                fully
                occupied by the exhaust ducts).</p>
              <p>I also carved the nose of the plane out of a solid piece of balsa. I cut out the block on the bandsaw
                to
                get a rough shape, and then hand carved the rest with a knife.</p>
              <p>Finally, I installed the rest of the electronics at the back of the plane, including the receiver and
                wiring to the servos/EDF motors. I then covered it up with a sheet of balsa and included a small hatch
                for
                access to the electronics. This made it easy to access them for fixing problems later. I also carved
                the
                "beaver tail" for the back of the plane.</p>

              <p>This is a very large plane, and it is relatively heavy compared to most model planes. Therefore it
                needed good landing gear. I decided to install retractible landing gear, which would allow me to use
                large enough landing gear while not impacting the flying too much.</p>
              <p>It was hard to fit the landing gear due to all the other stuff in the plane, like the batteries and
                intake, but I eventually found a configuration that worked.</p>
              <p>I then made a shell to cover the wing sweep area. This was a challenging region to cover because the
                wings needed to be mobile.</p>
              <p>Finally, I carved the exhaust ports for the back of the plane, and covered the remaining gaps along
                the
                rest of the body.</p>
              <p>As shown in the images above, the plane was now capable of fully retracting and extending the wings!
                This was my favorite feature.

              <p>Lastly, I worked on making the clear canopy for the cockpit. I started by carving the shape I wanted
                out of a leftover balsa block. Originally my plan was to just color it blue and act like it was glass,
                but I didn't like how it looked.</p>
              <p>I decided I wanted to have a clear canopy, but I wasn't able to find a way to buy one online since it
                was a custom build. I needed to come up with my own technique to make my own.</p>
              <p>After some thinking and searching, I found some clear plastic sheets that I didn't need anymore. I
                made
                a frame out of leftover wood from my shop, and secured a plastic sheet within it. I then heated it in
                my
                oven for a few minutes until it was soft, and then quickly took it out and stretched it over the block
                I
                had carved.</p>

              <p>This worked a lot better than I expected! I was able to get the exact shape I wanted. I still redid
                it
                a few times to experiment with different oven temperatures and times to try to minimize the bubbles
                and
                fogging that I was getting, and eventually I got a good one.</p>
              <p>I cut it out of the frame and installed it on the plane, and the project was complete!</p>

              <p>Here are some more images of the final product. I did try to fly the plane, but I crashed it during
                the
                takeoff. I was able to repair the damage, but I haven't tried to fly again since then :(. Also, after
                the project was complete, I made a nice walnut frame for my reference plans and hung it on the wall of
                my room.</p>

                <p>Working with hand tools requires a sturdy workbench to dampen vibrations and hold the piece in
                  place,
                  which
                  was why I decided to build this.
                  I made it out of sugar maple, a very dense hardwood. The top is four inches thick and the bench
                  weighs
                  more
                  than 200 pounds. It also includes a custom wagon vise that I designed to easily clamp my work
                  pieces
                  down.
                </p>
                <p>I have been using this workbench for around four years now, and it has been very helpful in
                  making
                  many of my other projects.</p>

                <p>This was my final paper for 8.06 (quantum III) at MIT. At the time I was also taking 18.676
                  (stochastic
                  calculus), and I was interested in learning more about
                  how it could be applied to physics.
                </p>
                <p> The paper discusses how stochastic processes like Brownian motion can be used to construct path
                  integral solutions
                  to PDEs including the Schrodinger equation. It then applies the quantum path integral to solve
                  statistical mechanics problems. I really enjoyed researching this paper, and I got to learn some
                  interesting interpretations of the physics I had studied in class.

            <h3>8.13 Experimental Physics Papers</h3>
            <p>I wrote these papers as part of my experimental physics class (8.13) in Spring 2025. I learned a lot
              about data analysis while doing these experiments. I also had a lot of fun with thinking of creative new
              techniques for some of them where the analysis was more open ended.</p>

                    <p>This was the last paper of the year for 8.13. We were given some cosmic ray muon detectors called
                      CosmicWatches, and asked to design our own open ended experiment that made use of them.</p>
                    <p>I measured the attenuation of muons in water, which is the rate of energy loss as they travel
                      through
                      a medium.
                      This determines a quantity called the meter water equivalence, which is used by particle physics
                      experiments to
                      determine how much shielding they achieve from background radiation.</p>
                    <p>I made muon rate measurements at the Charles River (at the docks and on a motorboat) and at White
                      Pond in Concord, MA (in a canoe)!
                      I used the rates and depths to determine the attenuation, and I had fun applying different
                      corrections
                      to account for the angular acceptance of the detectors and fluctuations due to atmospheric
                      pressure.

                    <p>This was the second major 8.13 experiment. I did the optical trapping experiment, in which we use
                      a laser to create a potential well
                      in which we can analyze and influence the motion of microscopic particles.</p>
                    <p>We began by measuring the motion of different sizes of beads under different laser powers, which
                      changes the strength of the trap.
                      Using these data, we were able to get a measurement of Boltzmann's constant from the power
                      spectral density of the oscillations.</p>
                    <p>I made another independent measurement of the constant that used the amplitude of the bead
                      oscillations, which I was able to obtain after calibrating the trap positions.
                      Finally, I made a third measurement using Stokes' drag force, which we were able to do by knowing
                      the diameter of the beads.</p>
                    <p>This information was used to calibrate the trap for measuring velocities and microscopic forces
                      in cell organelles.</p>

                    <p>My first 8.13 experiment was relativistic dynamics, where we determine the energy,
                      momentum, and velocity relations of relativistic electrons. </p>
                    <p>We made measurements of these three quantities, and performed fits to classical and relativistic
                      predictions to demonstrate that Newtonian mechanics does not describe fast electrons.</p>
                    <p>As a bonus, we were able to determine the electron charge to mass ratio as part of our analysis.
                    </p>
                    <p>This experiment was very interesting, but unfortunately our radioactive source wasn't aligned
                      properly. This caused us to get very low count rates (~10x less), which made the data taking
                      process take many extra sessions :(</p>

              <p>This was numerical project for 8.08 (statistical mechanics II) where we studied non-equilibrium
                systems.
              </p>
              <p>I decided to generalize a process we studied in class (geometric Brownian motion) and apply it to some
                real life examples. I then did some basic simulations and compared the results with my predictions from
                the Fokker-Planck equation.</p>
              <p>This was a fun, small project where I learned about simulating random processes. I ended up using some
                of the concepts I learned here to write my 8.06 quantum path integral project.</p>
